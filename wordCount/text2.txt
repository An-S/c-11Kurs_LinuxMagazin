Most  devices  are indicated by a filename (of a block special device), like /dev/sda1, but there are other possibilities.
For example, in the case of an NFS mount, device may look like knuth.cwi.nl:/dir.  It is also possible to indicate a block
special  device  using  its  filesystem  label  or UUID (see the -L and -U options below), or its partition label or UUID.
(Partition identifiers are supported for example for GUID Partition Tables (GPT).)

Don't forget that there is no guarantee that UUIDs and labels are really unique, especially if you move, share or copy the
device.  Use lsblk -o +UUID,PARTUUID to verify that the UUIDs are really unique in your system.

The recommended setup is to use tags (e.g. LABEL=label) rather than /dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,partuuid,partlabel} udev sym‚Äê
links in the /etc/fstab file.  Tags are more readable, robust and portable.  The mount(8)  command  internally  uses  udev
symlinks, so the use of symlinks in /etc/fstab has no advantage over tags.  For more details see libblkid(3).

Note  that mount(8) uses UUIDs as strings.  The UUIDs from the command line or from fstab(5) are not converted to internal
binary representation.  The string representation of the UUID should be based on lower case characters.

The proc filesystem is not associated with a special device, and when mounting it, an arbitrary keyword, such as proc  can
be  used  instead  of a device specification.  (The customary choice none is less fortunate: the error message `none busy'
from umount can be confusing.)
